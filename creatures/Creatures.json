Thus it looks like a cross between a cock and a drake. Legends say that they derive from cocks' eggs that hatch beneath a fell beast. Although their origin is clouded, it is clear that basilisks evolved so that their leathery surfaces became lighter and better insulated. Whatever the case, they have a hideous countenance which turns all who watch them and are gazed upon to stone (including themselves, should they look into a mirror). The only safe way to observe a basilisk is by its reflection. Tortured creatures, basilisks are constantly unhappy and extremely bitter. Despite their moderate intelligence, they seem unpredictable and insane. Their power is considerable, however, and whenever they employ their wailing hiss, all those within 50 ft. must resist fear (RR failure of 01-50 = 1-10 minutes flight; 51-100 = 1-100 minutes flight; 100+ = 1-10 rounds of paralyzed inactivity). Sharp talons and a vise-like beak complete their array of battle tools. Those that challenge a basilisk for their inevitably considerable treasure are either very strong or exceptionally stupid. (In the end, most are simply statuesque.)"

Utterly horrible, these are planes where life and death have no meaning. Here, Evil reigns and tortured demonic souls exist in a  twisted state - without hope, yet consumed by desire. Creatures of these hellish realms are either prisoners of their own misdeeds or spirts banished due to some misfortune. All lack comfortable alignment with this \"misbegotten land\". Demons of the Pale are categorized according to their plane, of which there are six. Individually called \"Pales\", these terrible realms compose a heirarchy of hideously insane existance. Of those within the Pale, First Pale Demons are the weakest; Demons of the Sixth Pale are the strongest. Demons \"Beyond the Pale\" exist in any Pale or on an entirely different plane, although they are not of the void. Exceedingly powerful creatures, their individuality defies categorization. Demons Beyond the Pale are spirits of downcast demigods (related to Ordainers) who have not yet been banished into the Void. Their tremendous power permits them to take gigantic forms, although none are fair-seeming. Agile and powerful, they swing great (two-hand) weapons with each hand and have the power of swift flight (60ft/rd acceleration; max speed 240ft/rd). Each possesses an almost irresistible voice and commanding presence which enables them to lead large groups or dominate exceptionally strong minds (as \"Spirit Mastery\" spell; lvl 50; Ess list \"Spirit Mastery\"). Those viewing them for the first time (within a 50ft radius) must make a RR vs fear. Failure of 01-25 results in the victim being immobilized by terror for 1-10 rds; failureof 26-100 forces the victim to flee for 1-10 hours, while a failure of 101+ results in instant death due to shock. Most spirits are tied to a specific element (e.g. fire), which allows them to command related elemental or base spells akin to their own makeup. Fire-spirits, for instance, know the \"Fire Law\" spell list, as well as any other spell whose name contains the word \"fire\" (while those of light know \"Light Law\" and any spell with a name including \"light\"). Given to immolation, demons beyond the pale can engulf themselves in fire, cold, or ball lightening, thereby delivering a \"D\" crit to all within 5ft of their huge, hideous bodies. Few creatures have so many tools of power, or so prone to wield them."

They will do whatever is necessary to smite their victim and always utilize the fastest, most complete manner possible. Black stalkers prefer to avoid delaying melees but when forced to fight, they will usually dispose of the opponent. The quick blades these creatures carry are reforged for each mission, thereby becoming a slaying broadsword keyed to a new target. Garbed in light, black, enchanted full plate demonskin armor (encumbers as AT-4; acts as AT-20) and a shadowy cloak of hiding (+50 to stalk/hide maneuvers), they prefer to hunt during hours of darkness. During daylight they sleep in a dark chamber, for they are weakened (-50) when exposed to natural sunlight or its enchanted equivalent. Darkness invigorates them and allows them great advantages over most prey. They have both infravision and, out of daylight, the power of limited hit regeneration (2 hits/rd)."

        "description":"Snakes are akin to lizards, but are limbless. Flexible and often quite quick, they rely on powerful jaws, venomous fangs, or strangling constriction to kill their prey. Some have jaws with detachable connections, enabling the snakes to free the upper and lower bones and swallow extremely large victims. Vipers ambush their prey, striking with their long poisonous fangs in frighteningly quicki attacks. Their muscle-poison immobilizes or kills their foes. Pit Vipers (e.g., rattlesnakes) are nocturnal varieties which use heat sensors to locate their quarry. Cobras use more powerful nerve-poisons which act faster and can kill very large prey, but cobra attacks are usually slower, and their venom is often delivered by a chewing rather than an injection method. Some cobras (10%), however, can spit their poison, blinding their adversary. Cobra-related Sea Snakes use the strongest venoms, but are entirely adapted to aquatic life and never venture on land (where their skeletons would collapse). Although air-breathers, they can stay under water for up to two hours. Of the non-poisonous varieties, constrictors (such as boas or pythons) are in many ways the most dangerous. Relatively large, they have strong teeth and use rapidly coiling movements to surround, entwine, strangle, and eventually swallow their prey."

These creatures are agile and fast and run on thin legs which are supported by sharp \"two-toed\" hooves. Although they are omnivorous, they generally feed on nuts, bulbs, and tubers, using their long, tough, sensitive snouts to dig up dinner. They will not overlook an offering of carrion, however, and when alarmed, may be quite dangerous. They can easily kill a foe by charging and biting or goring with their upward-curving tusks."

Ill-proportioned hands and feet display granite claws, while flattened nostrils deform a cruel visage. A perpetual snarl distorts the sneering maws of these battle fiends to reveal curving, blood-stained fangs. Grey, stoney hides with the rough texture of a  cliff face protect the calcified innards of reclusive, solitary Trolls, but more formidable armor guards the dread War Trolls. Articulated plates of Adamant (a stone-like material) grow naturally from their petrified skin, warding the sharp edges of an enemy's sword with ease. Bred to withstand the sun's bright gaze, War Trolls are quicker and cleverer than their ancient brethren. Hill Trolls are quicker and cleverer than their ancient brethren. Hill trolls (more timid, but equally fond of man-flesh) lose their sight when exposed to direct sunlight, while Stone Trolls return to the rock from which they were born."

        "description":"Demons of the Void are evil creatures who reside in the Nothingness outside Creation, apart from the Essence and beyond the known planes. They are of the realm at the very edge of Existence. Unlike Demons of the Pale, they are beings who were once of the \"high races\", but have long been changed. There are 3 kinds of these demons: 1). malformed spirits of fallen demigods; 2). Perverted elven spirits; and 3). Corrupt souls of immortal mannish spellcasters. All were cast into the Void as a result of heinous crimes or their own foul incantations. In any case, they were sundered from this world because of their own evil acts. Demons who dwell in the Void can only take form on known planes when under a summons or by entering a Gate to the Otherworlds. Since the Gates are guarded, their passage is often tied to a pardon, a rare event typically inspired by trickery. Like Demons of the Pale, these wicked spirits take distastful forms while in this world, thereby interacting with other beings. These forms serve as their conveyance, but are vulnerable and can be destroyed. Their \"real being\" or spirit, on the other hand, cannot be destroyed outside the Void.  Demons of the Void, like undead, are rated on a scale from I to VI, with Ordainers stretching off the bounds. An Ordainer may only be summoned by a spellcaster of at least 50th lvl utilizing a \"Summon Demons VI\" spell. They may never be controlled or mastered, although their presence outside the void usually requires the use of these spells.  The appropriate breakdown by numbers is: Type I, 5% (01-05); Type II, 8% (06-13); Type III, 20% (14-33); Type IV, 30% (34-63); Type V, 25% (64-88); Type VI, 10% (89-98); Ordainers, 2% (99-00).  While 0some are masterful enchanters, all these creatures can make use of spells from the Sorcerer base list \"Soul Destruction\" and the Evil Mentalist base list \"Mind Disease\".   The Daedhel, Culraug, Hodhedhel, Thauredhel, and the Celebdel arose out of the spirits of evil Evils. All possess the size (5.5-7 ft) and skills (e.g., infravision) they had in life, but have lost true form and have difficulty assuming fair guise.  Of all the Elf-demons, Celebdel are the most potent. Frightening yet cruelly noble, their very presence forces those within 50ft to make a RR vs fear. Those who fail by 01-50 flee for 1-2 minutes, while those who fail by more are frozen in terror for 1-10 rds. Because they wear bizarre silver crowns, Celebdel are called \"Silver Horrors\" by the High-elves. These crowns permit them 2 extra PP per lvl. These they use to cast spells from the Evil Mentalist base lists, all of which the Celebdel know to 20th lvl."

Some have jaws with detachable connections, enabling the snakes to free the upper and lower bones and swallow extremely large victims. Vipers ambush their prey, striking with their long poisonous fangs in frighteningly quicki attacks. Their muscle-poison immobilizes or kills their foes. Pit Vipers (e.g., rattlesnakes) are nocturnal varieties which use heat sensors to locate their quarry. Cobras use more powerful nerve-poisons which act faster and can kill very large prey, but cobra attacks are usually slower, and their venom is often delivered by a chewing rather than an injection method. Some cobras (10%), however, can spit their poison, blinding their adversary. Cobra-related Sea Snakes use the strongest venoms, but are entirely adapted to aquatic life and never venture on land (where their skeletons would collapse). Although air-breathers, they can stay under water for up to two hours. Of the non-poisonous varieties, constrictors (such as boas or pythons) are in many ways the most dangerous. Relatively large, they have strong teeth and use rapidly coiling movements to surround, entwine, strangle, and eventually swallow their prey."

Congers feast on fish, crustaceans, and even octopuses. Morey eels normally inhabit rocky shores. They possess very large mouths and sharp teeth. Moreys prey on fish and squid.  Eels classified as \"freshwater\" eels spawn and die in salt-water, but grow and live in freshwater estuaries and rivers. They feed on insects, crustaceans, and fish. Electric Eels also live in freshwater but even though they have long, slender bodies they are not true eels. Usually found in streams and pools, they prey on smaller fish and bottom-living invertebrates. These eels stun their food by releasing high voltage charges from special muscles."

These creatures are remarkably unintelligent but efficient killing machines which will gorge until they molt. Molting occurs 3-5 times during their long lives (lobsters can live to age 60) and involves the complete shedding of their shell and outer skin. After holing up and growing a new covering over a 2-5 week period, they emerge anew, often 15-25% larger. Lobsters and crabs share many of the same structures. They have long antennae which contain no pain-receiving nerves and, although very sensitive to food or danger, are designed to ignore damage. These beasts listen with their legs, taste with their feet, chew with their stomachs, and propel themselves backwards when swimming. Both have shell armor that covers their fused head and thorax, and each sports a pair of pincers. The slightly larger pincher is used to capture and crush prey, while the smaller claw has a sawtooth cutter and is generally a defensive weapon. Their claws immobilize a foe, allowing their side-chewing mandibles to tear it apart and deliver the pieces to the other four pairs of mouth parts. Food is \"chewed\" after delivery to the stomach. Crabs differ from lobsters in a number of ways, notably in terms of lifestyle. Both are burrowers who dig holes or live in nooks or caves, but the ultra-adaptable and numerous crab varieties are not confined to aquatic living. Many types live in extremely shallow water, on tidal flats, or in the sands above the high water mark. Although all live near the sea, some rarely venture in. Because crabs are often amphibious, they must be mobile on land and therefore have stronger legs and smaller pinchers. (All but the sea-dwelling Soldier Crab walk sideways.) On the other hand, lobsters are exclusively aquatic and prefer deep water. This allows them to grow disproportionately huge claws (as much as 60% of their body weight), for their water buoyancy aids in their mobility."

        "description":"Demons of the Void are evil creatures who reside in the Nothingness outside Creation, apart from the Essence and beyond the known planes. They are of the realm at the very edge of Existence. Unlike Demons of the Pale, they are beings who were once of the \"high races\", but have long been changed. There are 3 kinds of these demons: 1). malformed spirits of fallen demigods; 2). Perverted elven spirits; and 3). Corrupt souls of immortal mannish spellcasters. All were cast into the Void as a result of heinous crimes or their own foul incantations. In any case, they were sundered from this world because of their own evil acts. Demons who dwell in the Void can only take form on known planes when under a summons or by entering a Gate to the Otherworlds. Since the Gates are guarded, their passage is often tied to a pardon, a rare event typically inspired by trickery. Like Demons of the Pale, these wicked spirits take distastful forms while in this world, thereby interacting with other beings. These forms serve as their conveyance, but are vulnerable and can be destroyed. Their \"real being\" or spirit, on the other hand, cannot be destroyed outside the Void.  Demons of the Void, like undead, are rated on a scale from I to VI, with Ordainers stretching off the bounds. An Ordainer may only be summoned by a spellcaster of at least 50th lvl utilizing a \"Summon Demons VI\" spell. They may never be controlled or mastered, although their presence outside the void usually requires the use of these spells.  The appropriate breakdown by numbers is: Type I, 5% (01-05); Type II, 8% (06-13); Type III, 20% (14-33); Type IV, 30% (34-63); Type V, 25% (64-88); Type VI, 10% (89-98); Ordainers, 2% (99-00).  While some are masterful enchanters, all these creatures can make use of spells from the Sorcerer base list \"Soul Destruction\" and the Evil Mentalist base list \"Mind Disease\".   The Daedhel, Culraug, Hodhedhel, Thauredhel, and the Celebdel arose out of the spirits of evil Evils. All possess the size (5.5-7 ft) and skills (e.g., infravision) they had in life, but have lost true form and have difficulty assuming fair guise. The golden-red brethren of the Daedhel, the Culraug, have similar abilities. Enamored of fire and given to serving Fire-spirits, Culraug are also immune to flames and prefer warm places.

        "description":"Demons of the Void are evil creatures who reside in the Nothingness outside Creation, apart from the Essence and beyond the known planes. They are of the realm at the very edge of Existence. Unlike Demons of the Pale, they are beings who were once of the \"high races\", but have long been changed. There are 3 kinds of these demons: 1). malformed spirits of fallen demigods; 2). Perverted elven spirits; and 3). Corrupt souls of immortal mannish spellcasters. All were cast into the Void as a result of heinous crimes or their own foul incantations. In any case, they were sundered from this world because of their own evil acts. Demons who dwell in the Void can only take form on known planes when under a summons or by entering a Gate to the Otherworlds. Since the Gates are guarded, their passage is often tied to a pardon, a rare event typically inspired by trickery. Like Demons of the Pale, these wicked spirits take distastful forms while in this world, thereby interacting with other beings. These forms serve as their conveyance, but are vulnerable and can be destroyed. Their \"real being\" or spirit, on the other hand, cannot be destroyed outside the Void.  Demons of the Void, like undead, are rated on a scale from I to VI, with Ordainers stretching off the bounds. An Ordainer may only be summoned by a spellcaster of at least 50th lvl utilizing a \"Summon Demons VI\" spell. They may never be controlled or mastered, although their presence outside the void usually requires the use of these spells.  The appropriate breakdown by numbers is: Type I, 5% (01-05); Type II, 8% (06-13); Type III, 20% (14-33); Type IV, 30% (34-63); Type V, 25% (64-88); Type VI, 10% (89-98); Ordainers, 2% (99-00).  While some are masterful enchanters, all these creatures can make use of spells from the Sorcerer base list \"Soul Destruction\" and the Evil Mentalist base list \"Mind Disease\".  The Daedhel, Culraug, Hodhedhel, Thauredhel, and the Celebdel arose out of the spirits of evil Evils. All possess the size (5.5-7 ft) and skills (e.g., infravision) they had in life, but have lost true form and have difficulty assuming fair guise.  The Daedhel, or \"Shadow Elves\", appear as shadowy remnants of their former selves. They know all Sorcerer base lists to 5th lvl and enjoy high senses of Empathy and Intuition (85-102). Despising of light, they can cast \"Darkness\" (Ess, lvl 5, Darkness\")."

They are a stalwart people, comfortable below ground, where they delve labyrinthine mines and palatial dwellings. Like the Goblins, Dwarves are masters of metalcraft; but unlike those unsavory cavern dwellers, they design their works to exhibit beauty as well as strength and utility. Full of ridicule for the ways of conjurers, they employ such magicks only to enhance the powers of the weapons and artifacts reluctantly released from their forges. Dwarves are short and stocky with ruddy complexions; their dark eyes are deep set, generating the illusion of great wisdom, and their hair is brown or black, occasionally flame colored. The men grow long beards which they often braid. Infertility combined with a lack of females (who comprise less than a third of their kind) leads few Dwarves to marry or conceive young. Dwarves favor colorful, hooded clothing and hand arms. Many are proficient with standard bows, but a liking for mechanical devices prompts them to employ crossbows when a need for missile weapons arises."

Eels classified as \"freshwater\" eels spawn and die in salt-water, but grow and live in freshwater estuaries and rivers. They feed on insects, crustaceans, and fish. Electric Eels also live in freshwater but even though they have long, slender bodies they are not true eels. Usually found in streams and pools, they prey on smaller fish and bottom-living invertebrates. These eels stun their food by releasing high voltage charges from special muscles."

Constant movement enables an elemental to maintain shape. Their spirit lodges in a focus which, like the ice in the center of a snowball, becomes the core or the \"heart\" of the creature. Gathered material swirls around this focus, increasing in speed whenever the elemental hastens its pace or assumes a more compact form. Since these creatures are flexible and quasi-amorphous, they are difficult to slay. One dispatches an elemental by separating it from its spirit or by killing its core. Any slowing of its movement stuns it, however, so these creatures are vulnerable to any disruption of their material flow. When an elemental is frozen or disintegrated, it cannot function. Then its spirit must make a RR or it will depart, prompting the abandoned body to return to it's natural state. Elementals are vague, ever-shifting shapes. They maintain contact with the ground, but have no definitive appendages; nor do they have true facial features, although a hint of eyes or a mouth may suggest characteristics common to its spirit. The creature's arms, legs, and head take shape with need, such as when it wishes to strike or speak. As with all creatures, they depend on their substance and cannot wield anything much more solid than their own essential base. Only earth and water elementals can carry solid objects, while air, cold, fire, and light elementals are incapable of bearing any item."

Elephants fan themselves with their large ears, feed themselves with a long prehensile trunk (actually an elongated nose and upper lip), and walk on thick, pillarlike legs which end in flat, padded feet.  They use their size, their trunk, and a pair of curved ivory tusks when in combat.  Although they rest at midday and twice in the night, they are otherwise constantly active.  Elephants have poor eyesight, but otherwise their senses are excellent.  Young males may operate alone or in small groups, but elephants are primarily social beasts and prefer to travel in herds led by an old female.  All rely on leaves, shoots, grass, and fruit for their diet, feeding and drinking with their nimble trunks.  Indian elephants differ from the African variety by virtue of their smaller ears, gently humped back, and slightly smaller stature."

There are 72 species of civet, of which the mongoose is perhaps the most familiar. Civets are all small to medium in size, with long bodies, elongated heads, and short legs.

While sucking blood, they may deposit any one of the numerous disease organisms they carry (e.g., the bubonic plague) into the host's wound. Wingless, they move by leaping in a tumbling, cartwheel-like manner which allows them to jump distances equal to 100 to 300 times their own body length. Their enlongated rear legs provide the spring, while the shorter center and forward pairs are held up over and out from their body (respectively) to break the fall. In this way they can land in any position, even on their backs, before attacking. Fleas spot their targets by using movement-sensitive and heat-sensitive sensor hairs on the backs of their abdomens."

Using its sharp claws and a powerful vise-like bite, the hellbender immobilizes the adversary, drowns it, rises back to the surface with the body, rolls over, and proceeds to feed on the kill using its chest as a dinner table.

Sunlight does not harm them, but the brightness scares them and makes their eyes water, leading Gnolls to adhere to the underground realm. Skill as conjurers and magicians enables them to avoid encounters with other races, few gaining knowledge of their of their presence until after the Gnolls have passed from the area. They travel in clans and settle only in deserted grottos where access is limited and concealed. When sheltered by secrecy and stone, their timid dispositions relax and permit the injoyment of gleeful festivals. On these occasions, Gnolls put aside their sober, earth-toned clothing for more colorful garb."

A love of solitude ensures that most Gnomes remain heirless, rarely marrying or raising a family. Although loners, Gnomes are neither shy nor joyless; generous hospitality accompanied by ingenious entertainments draw many friends to visit as houseguests. Gnomes do not often return these visits, for they dislike abandoning their abodes and the treasures guarded within for even a few days."

To protect these sensitive appendages from hurt (and perhaps, to hide their lack of toes - all of the proper bones and ligaments are present, but the mass of flesh has not divided into separate digits), Goblins wear clumsy, stone clogs. When particularly enraged, they attempt to denude a scapegoat of his clogs and stamp with laughter upon the exposed limbs. Mechanical devices appeal to the clever cruelty intrinsic to Goblins; they have invented many machines of torture as well as those useful in warfare and siege. Utility and strength mark most of their creations, but beauty eludes them. Skilled miners, Goblins enlarge their underground kingdoms by connecting nearby caverns with tunnels. Often an entire mountain range may be webbed by these passages, effectively detouring travelers to longer routes. Goblins stay below ground by day, but night sees them swarming the lands in search of brutal amusement."

        "description":"Demons of the Void are evil creatures who reside in the Nothingness outside Creation, apart from the Essence and beyond the known planes. They are of the realm at the very edge of Existence. Unlike Demons of the Pale, they are beings who were once of the \"high races\", but have long been changed. There are 3 kinds of these demons: 1). malformed spirits of fallen demigods; 2). Perverted elven spirits; and 3). Corrupt souls of immortal mannish spellcasters. All were cast into the Void as a result of heinous crimes or their own foul incantations. In any case, they were sundered from this world because of their own evil acts. Demons who dwell in the Void can only take form on known planes when under a summons or by entering a Gate to the Otherworlds. Since the Gates are guarded, their passage is often tied to a pardon, a rare event typically inspired by trickery. Like Demons of the Pale, these wicked spirits take distastful forms while in this world, thereby interacting with other beings. These forms serve as their conveyance, but are vulnerable and can be destroyed. Their \"real being\" or spirit, on the other hand, cannot be destroyed outside the Void.  Demons of the Void, like undead, are rated on a scale from I to VI, with Ordainers stretching off the bounds. An Ordainer may only be summoned by a spellcaster of at least 50th lvl utilizing a \"Summon Demons VI\" spell. They may never be controlled or mastered, although their presence outside the void usually requires the use of these spells.  The appropriate breakdown by numbers is: Type I, 5% (01-05); Type II, 8% (06-13); Type III, 20% (14-33); Type IV, 30% (34-63); Type V, 25% (64-88); Type VI, 10% (89-98); Ordainers, 2% (99-00).  While some are masterful enchanters, all these creatures can make use of spells from the Sorcerer base list \"Soul Destruction\" and the Evil Mentalist base list \"Mind Disease\".  The Hothrog, Daerauk, Gogonaur, and Narauk comprise the changed souls of evil humans called \"Man-demons\". Like the demonic elven spirits, Man-demons possess the skills and stature they had in life, but lack true form or pleasant features."

They range over 4-16 square mile territories which are normally unguarded and unmarked. Gorillas avoid conflict with intruders through warnings, notably by drumming on their chests, screaming, and tearing apart foilage or nearby objects. Rivals for dominance amoung the troop may kill each other, however. Although females and the young are avid tree climbers, mature males are too heavy for most branches. When on the ground, gorillas move on all fours."

There are 3 kinds of these demons: 1). malformed spirits of fallen demigods; 2). Perverted elven spirits; and 3). Corrupt souls of immortal mannish spellcasters.

Since the Gates are guarded, their passage is often tied to a pardon, a rare event typically inspired by trickery. Like Demons of the Pale, these wicked spirits take distastful forms while in this world, thereby interacting with other beings. These forms serve as their conveyance, but are vulnerable and can be destroyed. Their \"real being\" or spirit, on the other hand, cannot be destroyed outside the Void.

One head, however, serves as the original (and immortal core). It cannot regenerate, nor can it be stunned; but if slain, the hydra perishes.

Smooth, brown suede-like skin emerges at these features, and the fur on the head lengthens and lightens to form a golden mane around the face. Green feline eyes give the Idiyva excellent night vision; fanged teeth reveal their carnivorous nature. The toes of their feet anchor short, sharp talons, but their hands sport viscious 3 inch claws that retract at the knuckle into the backs of the hands, leaving the fingers free at all times. The fighting instincts of a predator lurk behind the civilized manners that characterize most Idiyva, and the bloody custom of a duel to the death remains an acceptable way to settle social differences among themselves."

Unlike othe demons, they are not tied to a set coporeal form; instead, they are bound to a focus, such as an object or a place. This enables them to take many differing quasi-physical forms, but prevents them from having complete freedom of action. In fact, the wills of many genii are subject to the master of their focus (e.g., the owner of an oasis or holder of a jar). A genii's master must be an intelligent being. In the case of a non-portable focus, such as a place or an immovable item, the master is normally the first individual who touches the focus and remains in its sphere of influence (i.e., the radius the genii can operate). (GM's may wish to determine possession otherwise.)  The destruction of the genie's focus releases the demon from imprisonment in this world. However, since the genie is enslaved by its focus, it must protect the given object or place. These demons cannot employ spells or chicanery as a means of breaking their ties. Genii must rely on other ways to exact freedom and a return home. Typically, this involves the fulfillment of its accursed quest. In the case of the lower genii (the jann, jinn, and shaitan), the demons must grant their masters the required number of wishes. The greater genii - the cunningly evil ifrit and marid - have individual quests. There are five types of genii: jann, jinn, shaitan, ifrit, and marid, in ascending order of power. Although they vary in demeanor, those who are stronger tend to be the most evil. Their multitudinous forms are somewhat dependent on their inner characters, so that manifestations of the savage marid are invariably ugly. On the other hand, jann are pleasing of countenance, or at the very least comical.  Ifrit are Nature-spirits who have been tied to a specific location, yet who retain their freedom of will and need not reside in confined quarters. Still, an ifriti can only leave it focus for a limited time in a given day (1 min/lvl). Otherwise, it must stay within specific bounds (e.g., the border of a city quarter or the walls of a compound) or inside a set radius (10ft/lvl) of the appointed location. Clever but utterly wicked spell users, ifrit possess all the \"Evil Mentalist\" spell lists and PP equal to 3x their own lvl. They have no master, grant no wishes, and show no compassion."

Jann are lesser demons commonly found residing in fixed containers around or in a household, typically storage bins, closed wells, rooms, and the like.

Such a wish can involve the transference of any one object (up to a radius = 10ft. X janni's lvl;  range = 10 miles x janni's lvl), but cannot involve the creation or transformation of a thing. A janni can offer an existing replacement, but cannot renew life or mend what is broken; nor can it transfer items or creatures which are not fixed to the desired object. (However, should the master desire to use a \"Force Analysis\" spell [Ess., \"Dark Contacts\"] in lieu of a wish, the janni will analyze an item with no chance of failure).  When the janni's container is opened, it can come forth for 1-100 minutes, but must return at the appointed time or whenever its master so commands. Both its will and spirit are bound within the focus, and whosoever rightfully owns the container is its master. It must serve and obey him, despite the janni's mischievous nature. Generally jovial and friendly, jann can be troublesome pests when released and uncontrolled. Their pranks have been the downfall of many a fine fellow."

Should a jinni's focus be transferred to the ownership of another, all prior wishes are forgotten and the jinni must begin anew. Upon the fulfillment of the first wish by the new master, physical objects acquired by the previous owners as a result of wishes simply \"disappear\" (returning to the point and state where they were before the wish).  Jinni can be released from their focus for up to 10 hours but, like a janni must return upon its master's command. While about, it appears friendly and servile; however a jinni is actually conniving and untrustworthy. Although  its spirit and will are tied to its container and it must obey its owner as master, a jinni will only follow the literal wording of orders. Whenever possible, it will twist meaning to fit its own, sneaky desires, thereby transforming simple wishes into dangerous propositions. (However, should the master desire to use a \"Force Analysis\" or a \"Force Information\" spell [Ess, \"Dark Contacts\" list] in lieu of  wish, the jinni will analyze an item or answer a question with no chance of failure.)"

Another distinguishing characteristic is the number of teeth; while porpoises have 60-80, dolphins have 100 or more.  Dolphins are most commonly found in coastal waters. Their markings are variable but all possess a distinctive, long beak. Fast swimmers, they feed on fish, shrimp, mollusks, and crustaceans.  Killer whales are the largest species of dolphin, even though they don't possess the usual beak. With their 40-50 teeth they prey on fish, other whales, squid, and even birds. River Dolphins are recognized by their prominent foreheads and very long beaks. They feed on small fish and crustaceans. Porpoises are small, beakless whales which range equally through coastal and deep oceanic waters. They feed on squid and fish."

        "description":"Genii are Household or Nature demons, trapped spirits from outside the world. Unlike othe demons, they are not tied to a set coporeal form; instead, they are bound to a focus, such as an object or a place. This enables them to take many differing quasi-physical forms, but prevents them from having complete freedom of action. In fact, the wills of many genii are subject to the master of their focus (e.g., the owner of an oasis or holder of a jar). A genii's master must be an intelligent being. In the case of a non-portable focus, such as a place or an immovable item, the master is normally the first individual who touches the focus and remains in its sphere of influence (i.e., the radius the genii can operate). (GM's may wish to determine possession otherwise.)  The destruction of the genie's focus releases the demon from imprisonment in this world. However, since the genie is enslaved by its focus, it must protect the given object or place. These demons cannot employ spells or chicanery as a means of breaking their ties. Genii must rely on other ways to exact freedom and a return home. Typically, this involves the fulfillment of its accursed quest. In the case of the lower genii (the jann, jinn, and shaitan), the demons must grant their masters the required number of wishes. The greater genii - the cunningly evil ifrit and marid - have individual quests. There are five types of genii: jann, jinn, shaitan, ifrit, and marid, in ascending order of power. Although they vary in demeanor, those who are stronger tend to be the most evil. Their multitudinous forms are somewhat dependent on their inner characters, so that manifestations of the savage marid are invariably ugly. On the other hand, jann are pleasing of countenance, or at the very least comical.  Marid are the most powerful and evil of all genii. Like the ifrit, they have free will and the ability to move outside their focus. A marid's focus, however, is not a location; instead it is a specific mobile object, such as an orb or a sword. The one who owns or bears the item does not command the maridi, although he does direct where the demon must go. A maridi can never leave the area around the focus (radius of 10ft/lvl), nor can the demon move its object or force the focus' possessor (who, like all masters, must be an intelligent being), since few are as strong as these demons.  Marid are dangerous spell users, possessing all the \"Sorcerer\" base spell lists, as well as the \"Essence Hand\" and \"Lesser Illusions\" lists. They receive 5 PP per lvl. Their most dangerous tool may be the power to grant \"false wishes\". These, they handle as a shaitani might undertake a real (transferring or transforming) wish, but marid will invariably cancel the request, either on a whim or at a preset time. Generally a maridi will obviate the wish at a time which is most detrimental to the grantee. For instance, with the first critical use of the desired end (e.g., one is besieged in his wished-for tower or wielding a wished-for mace in real combat), the wished-for attributes or object will return to its normal state. Marid conceal their true nature, so the victims of their falsehoods typically believe that they are dealing with other genii."

        "description":"Ancient fish are often remarkably similar to their descendants. Being a relatively stable environment, change comes slot to the sea. Still, the Elder Days produced a number of uniquely dangerous predators, the most conspicuous being the megalodon or \"giant shark\".   Like the great hunting sharks, the megalodon is always on the prowl, constantly swimming and feeding. Its acute senses allow it to perceive slight changes in water pressure and subtle odor shifts at ranges exceeding one mile. Sudden movements and blood spills attract it from afar. Their quick, meandering approach usually (75%) results in a frightening attack, particularly if the potential meal is wounded (95%). Fresh blood may spawn a megalodon \"frenzy\", a sort of rampaging orgy. At that point, one's best defense is to stun the megalodon, either by whapping it \"upside the head\" or out maneuvering the charge and striking it on its large, smooth, vulnerable sides. The shark's \"soft\", flexible cartilage skeleton fails to protect its precious organs as well as the bony structure found in most fish. In addition, the megalodon will run from most sonic attacks. They prefer easy meals, and flee if shocked or badly wounded. Their flight is invariably accompanied by a discharge of excrement, which acts as a cloud covering their retreat."

        "description":"Demons of the Void are evil creatures who reside in the Nothingness outside Creation, apart from the Essence and beyond the known planes. They are of the realm at the very edge of Existence. Unlike Demons of the Pale, they are beings who were once of the \"high races\", but have long been changed. There are 3 kinds of these demons: 1). malformed spirits of fallen demigods; 2). Perverted elven spirits; and 3). Corrupt souls of immortal mannish spellcasters. All were cast into the Void as a result of heinous crimes or their own foul incantations. In any case, they were sundered from this world because of their own evil acts. Demons who dwell in the Void can only take form on known planes when under a summons or by entering a Gate to the Otherworlds. Since the Gates are guarded, their passage is often tied to a pardon, a rare event typically inspired by trickery. Like Demons of the Pale, these wicked spirits take distastful forms while in this world, thereby interacting with other beings. These forms serve as their conveyance, but are vulnerable and can be destroyed. Their \"real being\" or spirit, on the other hand, cannot be destroyed outside the Void.  Demons of the Void, like undead, are rated on a scale from I to VI, with Ordainers stretching off the bounds. An Ordainer may only be summoned by a spellcaster of at least 50th lvl utilizing a \"Summon Demons VI\" spell. They may never be controlled or mastered, although their presence outside the void usually requires the use of these spells.  The appropriate breakdown by numbers is: Type I, 5% (01-05); Type II, 8% (06-13); Type III, 20% (14-33); Type IV, 30% (34-63); Type V, 25% (64-88); Type VI, 10% (89-98); Ordainers, 2% (99-00).  While some are masterful enchanters, all these creatures can make use of spells from the Sorcerer base list \"Soul Destruction\" and the Evil Mentalist base list \"Mind Disease\".  The Ordainers and their lesser brethren, the Noble GoGonaur, are demigodal spirits whose avarice led to their fall from grace. These Demons of Might were cast out as they upset the Balance of Things. Most became imprisoned, but many were destroyed and passed beyond Existence. A few survived to dwell in the depths of the earth, laying in wait as a dormant curse upon the world. Like the Demon Beyond the Pale, they are terrifyingly powerful creatures, with a thirst for lordship and a hunger for casual revenge. The mightiest of the Demons of the Void, however, are the greater Ordainers, the Moloch. These lordly demigods are high servants of evil, brilliant, yet exceptionally cruel masters of hate. All are unique in guise and possess the power to change shape at will (1 rd prep), although they cannot hold fair form without concentration. In their usual state, they are huge, hideous beasts, with tremendous wings and well-muscled arms and legs.  Like the less spectacular Raukamar, Moloch can fly (30ft/rd) and employ Essence or Mentalist base spells to their level (lvl x 5 PP). When utilizing arms they carry two 2-handed weapons, striking each round as if 2 individuals. When unarmed, they simply use their fists, which strike as maces. In any case, their immense strength yields 3x damage. Given to immolation, the Moloch can explode into flame or shroud himself in ice, and all within 6ft receive a \"D\" heat or cold crit each round they remain in the terrible, flickering radius. A Moloch can also \"ordain\" a foe, tearing the target's soul from his body with a 30th lvl \"Absolution\" (Ess list; \"Soul Destruction\")."

Eels classified as \"freshwater\" eels spawn and die in salt-water, but grow and live in freshwater estuaries and rivers. They feed on insects, crustaceans, and fish. Electric Eels also live in freshwater but even though they have long, slender bodies they are not true eels.

Hoofed beasts, they are adapted to fast, fluid running. (Their hoof is actually an extended 3rd toe.)  They live in herds and migrate between grasslands, depending on changes in supply and weather. Domesticated horses come in many varieties.  Ponies are exceptionally rugged and often shaggy-haired creatures, wellsuited to difficult climes. Plow horses and war horses are huge breeds which are adapted to heavy work and cavalry warfare, respectively.  Bred for short sprints (e.g., 1/4 mile), quarter horses are light, delicate, and swift.  All of them can be mixed breeds or pure breeds."

Noble Gogonaur are great Fire-spirits, demons who were once lower demigods. They serve as a model for the lesser Fire-demons and, as such, their appearance is that of larger (13ft tall) Gogonaur. They possess all the powers of the Gogonaur, but are more cunning and capable. Their critical strikes are accompanied by \"B\" fire crits and most (80%) are armed with Fire-weapons (e.g., a \"Sword of Flame\"), great two-hand arms that they wield in but one hand (delivering 3x damage). All Noble Gogonaur can cast 30 PP/day of spells drawn from the Magician base list \"Fire Law\". Their thick, smooth hide is both enchanted and resilient, and cannot be harmed by normal weapons."

        "description":"Snakes are akin to lizards, but are limbless. Flexible and often quite quick, they rely on powerful jaws, venomous fangs, or strangling constriction to kill their prey. Some have jaws with detachable connections, enabling the snakes to free the upper and lower bones and swallow extremely large victims. Vipers ambush their prey, striking with their long poisonous fangs in frighteningly quicki attacks. Their muscle-poison immobilizes or kills their foes. Pit Vipers (e.g., rattlesnakes) are nocturnal varieties which use heat sensors to locate their quarry. Cobras use more powerful nerve-poisons which act faster and can kill very large prey, but cobra attacks are usually slower, and their venom is often delivered by a chewing rather than an injection method. Some cobras (10%), however, can spit their poison, blinding their adversary. Cobra-related Sea Snakes use the strongest venoms, but are entirely adapted to aquatic life and never venture on land (where their skeletons would collapse). Although air-breathers, they can stay under water for up to two hours. Of the non-poisonous varieties, constrictors (such as boas or pythons) are in many ways the most dangerous. Relatively large, they have strong teeth and use rapidly coiling movements to surround, entwine, strangle, and eventually swallow their prey."

In the wild, these creatures travel in herd groups of 5-100 and defend themselves by keeping the older, weaker, or younger beasts at the center of the herd and fleeing or forming a circle ringed by stronger males.  Water buffalos are compact, bulky creatures who feed on rich grass and spend their off hours in the water or wallowing in mud. When submerged in water, they prefer to keep their entire body submerged, allowing only their muzzle to be seen.  Their flattened, upward-curving horns are the largest found among bovids, but these beasts rarely use them in combat, for they are exceptally timid and docile."

In the wild, these creatures travel in herd groups of 5-100 and defend themselves by keeping the older, weaker, or younger beasts at the center of the herd and fleeing or forming a circle ringed by stronger males.  Water buffalos are compact, bulky creatures who feed on rich grass and spend their off hours in the water or wallowing in mud. When submerged in water, they prefer to keep their entire body submerged, allowing only their muzzle to be seen.  Their flattened, upward-curving horns are the largest found among bovids, but these beasts rarely use them in combat, for they are exceptally timid and docile."

They resemble First Pale varieties in stature and structure, but possess black skin, huge hands, and large, prehensile tongues and feet. Their flowing red eyes and foot-long tongues create a frightening visage. Nearly all are virtually immune to extremes of temperature, particularly fire, and pain seems alien to their being. Worst yet, they are powerful and elusive foes. With their recurved musculature, they are given to feats of tremendous acrobatic skill and rarely paralleled strength. Even after twisting leaps of up to 100ft, they can right themselves for a crushing blow or a seemingly impossible hold on a vertical rock face. They frequently accomplish the latter maneuver by driving their clawed hands and feet into the sheer and solid rock, literally gripping the torn surface. Such fearless displays of raw, dexterous power are inherent in their character, and many have been known to tear the head off of a fallen foe with one swift motion."

Some have jaws with detachable connections, enabling the snakes to free the upper and lower bones and swallow extremely large victims. Vipers ambush their prey, striking with their long poisonous fangs in frighteningly quicki attacks. Their muscle-poison immobilizes or kills their foes. Pit Vipers (e.g., rattlesnakes) are nocturnal varieties which use heat sensors to locate their quarry. Cobras use more powerful nerve-poisons which act faster and can kill very large prey, but cobra attacks are usually slower, and their venom is often delivered by a chewing rather than an injection method. Some cobras (10%), however, can spit their poison, blinding their adversary. Cobra-related Sea Snakes use the strongest venoms, but are entirely adapted to aquatic life and never venture on land (where their skeletons would collapse). Although air-breathers, they can stay under water for up to two hours. Of the non-poisonous varieties, constrictors (such as boas or pythons) are in many ways the most dangerous. Relatively large, they have strong teeth and use rapidly coiling movements to surround, entwine, strangle, and eventually swallow their prey."

Killer whales are the largest species of dolphin, even though they don't possess the usual beak. With their 40-50 teeth they prey on fish, other whales, squid, and even birds. River Dolphins are recognized by their prominent foreheads and very long beaks. They feed on small fish and crustaceans.

They are divided into two groups: lesser primates, like aye-aye, lemurs, mouse-lemurs, tarsiers, and lorises; and higher primates, including marmosets, monkeys, apes, and hominids (e.g. man). As a whole, primates are generally either arboreal or live in open areas near woodlands. They are relatively bright creatures who have grasping hands and a good sense of sight. Most are herbivores who eat fruit, roots, buds, nuts, and suppliment their diet with insects and eggs. Orangutans, chimpanzees (both great apes), and men are omnivores. All species (aside from man) are found in tropical or subtropical locales.  Lesser primates are relatively small, primitive beasts who have long snouts and lack stereoscopic vision. They have long, non-prehensile tails and move by scurrying or leaping along or between branches. Some (10%) are loners, but the majority move in small troops of 10-40 around a well-defined territory. Although they lackthe superb depth perception found in higher primates, they have sensitive hearing and see well in dark areas. Most of (about 75%) these groups are nocturnal creatures.  Marmosets and tamarins are small higher primates that move through the trees like squirrels. Social animals, they live in small family groups and communicate with frequent, high-pitched cries. At night, they curl up and sleep in holes in trees. Monkeys are larger than marmosets and tamarins. Within this grouping, there are two types. New World monkeys are marked by flat noses, generally prehensile tails (80%), feet with opposing (grasping) toes, and long, thin hands which usually (80%) lack opposing thumbs. They live in extremely loud family units of 5-35. The larger, quieter Old World monkeys have longer noses and almost all (95%) lack prehensile tails. This group includes ground-dwelling baboons, and is characterized by bare buttocks and relatively large (5-200) social structures. Gibbons are apes, higher primates who differ from the great apes by virtue of their size and means of locomotion. Like all apes, they lack tails. Remarkable tree climbers, they have extremely long arms and hooked hands which are ideal for swinging from branch to branch. No primate is as skilled in the arts of moving in the trees. When on the ground, they usually hold their arms upward in order to avoid dragging them. The great apes are robust and often huge creatures. Chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas fall into this category. These beasts live in small troops of 5-15 and operate in set territories, which they can defend quite effectively. They are good climbers who have adapted well to ground movement (where they normally walk on all fours). Brighter individuals and most chimpanzees make use of simple tools and rather complex tactics. Strong, even the small chimps can break a mans arm with one snap of a single hand."

        "description":"Primates are warm-blooded mammals, an order which includes man. They are divided into two groups: lesser primates, like aye-aye, lemurs, mouse-lemurs, tarsiers, and lorises; and higher primates, including marmosets, monkeys, apes, and hominids (e.g. man). As a whole, primates are generally either arboreal or live in open areas near woodlands. They are relatively bright creatures who have grasping hands and a good sense of sight. Most are herbivores who eat fruit, roots, buds, nuts, and suppliment their diet with insects and eggs. Orangutans, chimpanzees (both great apes), and men are omnivores. All species (aside from man) are found in tropical or subtropical locales.  Lesser primates are relatively small, primitive beasts who have long snouts and lack stereoscopic vision. They have long, non-prehensile tails and move by scurrying or leaping along or between branches. Some (10%) are loners, but the majority move in small troops of 10-40 around a well-defined territory. Although they lackthe superb depth perception found in higher primates, they have sensitive hearing and see well in dark areas. Most of (about 75%) these groups are nocturnal creatures.  Marmosets and tamarins are small higher primates that move through the trees like squirrels. Social animals, they live in small family groups and communicate with frequent, high-pitched cries. At night, they curl up and sleep in holes in trees. Monkeys are larger than marmosets and tamarins. Within this grouping, there are two types. New World monkeys are marked by flat noses, generally prehensile tails (80%), feet with opposing (grasping) toes, and long, thin hands which usually (80%) lack opposing thumbs. They live in extremely loud family units of 5-35. The larger, quieter Old World monkeys have longer noses and almost all (95%) lack prehensile tails. This group includes ground-dwelling baboons, and is characterized by bare buttocks and relatively large (5-200) social structures. Gibbons are apes, higher primates who differ from the great apes by virtue of their size and means of locomotion. Like all apes, they lack tails. Remarkable tree climbers, they have extremely long arms and hooked hands which are ideal for swinging from branch to branch. No primate is as skilled in the arts of moving in the trees. When on the ground, they usually hold their arms upward in order to avoid dragging them. The great apes are robust and often huge creatures. Chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas fall into this category. These beasts live in small troops of 5-15 and operate in set territories, which they can defend quite effectively. They are good climbers who have adapted well to ground movement (where they normally walk on all fours). Brighter individuals and most chimpanzees make use of simple tools and rather complex tactics. Strong, even the small chimps can break a mans arm with one snap of a single hand."

These great warm-blooded flying beasts have (usually white) fur-covered bodies, short legs, sharply curving talons, and disproportionately large wings. The pterosaur's furry wings are actually formed of extremely thin skin and membranes, a webbing stretched between their arms and an elongated outer finger (like those of bats). Extremely light and awkward when walking (they cannot run), they operate best in the air. Their phenomenal gliding ability enables them to soar about for hours without flapping. They take off by stretching their wings against the lightest breezes. Once in the air, they manipulate the drafts and maneuver with artful skill, searching for carrion or small beasts. Pterosaurs have superb hearing and eyesight and, although amazingly light (35-60 lbs), large individuals can swoop down and carry off loads of up to 200 lbs. (When standing, however, they cannot lift off when bearing any appreciable weight.) Ever hungry, they can be very dangerous."

These great warm-blooded flying beasts have (usually white) fur-covered bodies, short legs, sharply curving talons, and disproportionately large wings. The pterosaur's furry wings are actually formed of extremely thin skin and membranes, a webbing stretched between their arms and an elongated outer finger (like those of bats). Extremely light and awkward when walking (they cannot run), they operate best in the air. Their phenomenal gliding ability enables them to soar about for hours without flapping. They take off by stretching their wings against the lightest breezes. Once in the air, they manipulate the drafts and maneuver with artful skill, searching for carrion or small beasts. Pterosaurs have superb hearing and eyesight and, although amazingly light (35-60 lbs), large individuals can swoop down and carry off loads of up to 200 lbs. (When standing, however, they cannot lift off when bearing any appreciable weight.) Ever hungry, they can be very dangerous."

        "description":"Demons of the Void are evil creatures who reside in the Nothingness outside Creation, apart from the Essence and beyond the known planes. They are of the realm at the very edge of Existence. Unlike Demons of the Pale, they are beings who were once of the \"high races\", but have long been changed. There are 3 kinds of these demons: 1). malformed spirits of fallen demigods; 2). Perverted elven spirits; and 3). Corrupt souls of immortal mannish spellcasters. All were cast into the Void as a result of heinous crimes or their own foul incantations. In any case, they were sundered from this world because of their own evil acts. Demons who dwell in the Void can only take form on known planes when under a summons or by entering a Gate to the Otherworlds. Since the Gates are guarded, their passage is often tied to a pardon, a rare event typically inspired by trickery. Like Demons of the Pale, these wicked spirits take distastful forms while in this world, thereby interacting with other beings. These forms serve as their conveyance, but are vulnerable and can be destroyed. Their \"real being\" or spirit, on the other hand, cannot be destroyed outside the Void.  Demons of the Void, like undead, are rated on a scale from I to VI, with Ordainers stretching off the bounds. An Ordainer may only be summoned by a spellcaster of at least 50th lvl utilizing a \"Summon Demons VI\" spell. They may never be controlled or mastered, although their presence outside the void usually requires the use of these spells.  The appropriate breakdown by numbers is: Type I, 5% (01-05); Type II, 8% (06-13); Type III, 20% (14-33); Type IV, 30% (34-63); Type V, 25% (64-88); Type VI, 10% (89-98); Ordainers, 2% (99-00).  While some are masterful enchanters, all these creatures can make use of spells from the Sorcerer base list \"Soul Destruction\" and the Evil Mentalist base list \"Mind Disease\".  The Ordainers and their lesser brethren, the Noble GoGonaur, are demigodal spirits whose avarice led to their fall from grace. These Demons of Might were cast out as they upset the Balance of Things. Most became imprisoned, but many were destroyed and passed beyond Existence. A few survived to dwell in the depths of the earth, laying in wait as a dormant curse upon the world. Like the Demon Beyond the Pale, they are terrifyingly powerful creatures, with a thirst for lordship and a hunger for casual revenge.  Raukamar are lesser Ordainers, Fire - or Ice-spirits who embody great strength and power. Appearing as huge (12-15ft tall) man-like forms veiled in blackness, their pitiless image fosters fear. The sight of such a presence is such that all non-demonic creatures viewing the demon must roll a successful RR or flee in terror (for 1-100 min). RR failure of greater than 100 results in death due to shock. Once a person has stood and fought a Raukamar, he is immune to the fear auras of all lesser lvl Raukamar. Raukamar can bathe themselves in fire or an icy mist, immolating with explosive vengence and each round inflicting a \"C\" heat or cold crit on all characters within a 5ft radius. Horned and winged, they can take flight, moving 25ft/rd, like fiery fell beasts. These demons possess spells from the open Essence and Mentalist spell lists. They know all of these lists to their lvl, and receive 3 PP/lvl."

        "description":"Reindeer (or caribou) are large deer, the only species where both males and females grow horns.  They vary in coloration, but all have large, heavily branched antlers.  Herd animals, they travel in often huge, migratory groups that circulate between the tundra (in summer) and coniferous taiga forests (in colder periods).  Lone adult males, however, are not common.  Because of their preference for cold weather, their ability to injest scrub and lichens, and their ability to megotiate rugged, snowbound terrain (they have wide two-toed hooves), reindeer are fine winter draft animals.  No beast, save perhaps the dog, is so well suited to extreme cold climes."

Their short, stout legs and three-toed hooves support their great frames and give them surprising mobility. This agility, coupled with their size, horns, and tough armor-hide, make rhinos formidable adversaries. As a whole, rhinos are solitary animals. A mating pair may live together, but most are loners, particularly older males. Only the rare, huge, timid, \"square-lipped\" or \"white\" rhinoceros live in troups. The more aggressive black rhino operates in overlapping ranges marked by dung heaps. All groups eat grass, leaves, weeds, twigs, and other rough plant matter. Rhinos have excellent senses of smell and hearing, but their sight is poor. They move and feed at all hours and rest at various times during the day and night. Self-appointed fire control experts, rhinos will attempt to stomp out any small, open fires (e.g. campfires) he may perceive or happen upon."

Although most of the dolphins have beaks, porpoises are all beakless. River dolphins display the longest beaks. Another distinguishing characteristic is the number of teeth; while porpoises have 60-80, dolphins have 100 or more.  Dolphins are most commonly found in coastal waters. Their markings are variable but all possess a distinctive, long beak. Fast swimmers, they feed on fish, shrimp, mollusks, and crustaceans.  Killer whales are the largest species of dolphin, even though they don't possess the usual beak. With their 40-50 teeth they prey on fish, other whales, squid, and even birds. River Dolphins are recognized by their prominent foreheads and very long beaks. They feed on small fish and crustaceans. Porpoises are small, beakless whales which range equally through coastal and deep oceanic waters. They feed on squid and fish."

        "description":"Snakes are akin to lizards, but are limbless. Flexible and often quite quick, they rely on powerful jaws, venomous fangs, or strangling constriction to kill their prey. Some have jaws with detachable connections, enabling the snakes to free the upper and lower bones and swallow extremely large victims. Vipers ambush their prey, striking with their long poisonous fangs in frighteningly quicki attacks. Their muscle-poison immobilizes or kills their foes. Pit Vipers (e.g., rattlesnakes) are nocturnal varieties which use heat sensors to locate their quarry. Cobras use more powerful nerve-poisons which act faster and can kill very large prey, but cobra attacks are usually slower, and their venom is often delivered by a chewing rather than an injection method. Some cobras (10%), however, can spit their poison, blinding their adversary. Cobra-related Sea Snakes use the strongest venoms, but are entirely adapted to aquatic life and never venture on land (where their skeletons would collapse). Although air-breathers, they can stay under water for up to two hours. Of the non-poisonous varieties, constrictors (such as boas or pythons) are in many ways the most dangerous. Relatively large, they have strong teeth and use rapidly coiling movements to surround, entwine, strangle, and eventually swallow their prey."

Long, dextrous fingers capped by a claw-like nail aid them in becoming accomplished craftsmen and bowmen. They build longships in which to ply the seas, raiding and plundering other vessels as pirates. Leather armor and curved swords are their usual battle garb. Their boats serve as their only home in spite of the fact that most can not swim.  Sea-Krals fear the hungry waves, but derive too much pleasure from their violent way of life to abandon the ocean."

Seals can reach speeds of 16 mph, while Sea Lions can dive to depths of 600+ feet.  Aside from their fixed hind flippers, Seals differ from Walruses and Sea Lions by virtue of their internal ears and an exceptionally streamlined body.

Unlike othe demons, they are not tied to a set coporeal form; instead, they are bound to a focus, such as an object or a place. This enables them to take many differing quasi-physical forms, but prevents them from having complete freedom of action. In fact, the wills of many genii are subject to the master of their focus (e.g., the owner of an oasis or holder of a jar). A genii's master must be an intelligent being. In the case of a non-portable focus, such as a place or an immovable item, the master is normally the first individual who touches the focus and remains in its sphere of influence (i.e., the radius the genii can operate). (GM's may wish to determine possession otherwise.)  The destruction of the genie's focus releases the demon from imprisonment in this world. However, since the genie is enslaved by its focus, it must protect the given object or place. These demons cannot employ spells or chicanery as a means of breaking their ties. Genii must rely on other ways to exact freedom and a return home. Typically, this involves the fulfillment of its accursed quest. In the case of the lower genii (the jann, jinn, and shaitan), the demons must grant their masters the required number of wishes. The greater genii - the cunningly evil ifrit and marid - have individual quests. There are five types of genii: jann, jinn, shaitan, ifrit, and marid, in ascending order of power. Although they vary in demeanor, those who are stronger tend to be the most evil. Their multitudinous forms are somewhat dependent on their inner characters, so that manifestations of the savage marid are invariably ugly. On the other hand, jann are pleasing of countenance, or at the very least comical.  Shaitan are similar in power to jinn, but are wilder, stronger, meaner, and rather impish. As such, they cannot take truly fair forms. Their guises must be small (max 5 ft.) and either weird or humorous. A shaitani will grant its master 1 greater wish, a request which will either transfer or transform an object, but cannot involve an act of creation or lifegiving. These demons are tied to a natural feature (e.g., a pool or tree), but are not confined to a life in a container; instead they exist within or outside their focus (must bein a radius = 10ft x lvl). Both their will and spirit are subject to the guidelines of their master. (However, should the master desire to use a \"Force Analysis\", \"Force Information\", or a \"Force Search\" spell [Ess, \"Dark Contacts\" list] in lieu of a wish, the shaitani will analyze the item, answer a question, or conduct a search with no chance of failure.)"

Movements in these sensitive devices are keyed to vibration receptors in the spider's legs, allowing the spider to distinguish between wind girations and the presence of prey. Once alerted, the spider will move on the trapped victim, using its powerful jaws to finish the poor sot. There are a numberof variations on the web trap. One variety uses tempting \"fishing lines\", dangling threads ending with a lure and covered with extremely thick fluid. Others build silk-lined pit traps or actually resort to tossing small snare-webs at passing victims. Feasting often involves the injection of a solvent fluid which combines with the victims innards to produce a jelly-like meal. The spider then sucks the food out of the lifeless body.

It moves along with a gliding/pulling action. Contrary to legend, octopus rarely grow larger than approx. 17 ft. (including tentacles).  Squid capture their prey on the suckered tips of two long tentacles, then haul it to the mouth region where it is held fast by smaller tentacles. Squid are fast swimmers, forcing water through an adjustable nozzle in a type of jet propulsion. Squid very greatly in size, ranging for 18 in. to the giant squid of up to almost 60 ft. in length.

They prey upon the sleeping, coming in the night like beautiful, terrifying dreams, and seducing their quarry with spells and soothing words. In this way they achieve their goal, which is the conception of a half human demon child, one who will serve them for eternity. Unfortunately, their chosen mate usually (75%) dies at childbirth, although a witch or warlock will have a better chance of survival (50%). The successful offspring of these creatures appear as wild humans, but many (25%) are born misshapen and crippled.  All incubi share similar powers. Shapechangers, they can alter their size (from 5-14 ft; 4+ one D10) and exterior features ( or shift to mist form) whenever they concentrate (1 rd. prep), enabling them to change both their strengths and identity. An incubus or succubus cannot, however, change its odor (which is musky and slightly foul) or its fundamental structure, the latter of which resembles that of a normal man or woman, but for their cloven feet. These demons possess all the Mentalist base lists and receive 6 PP per lvl. Additionally, incubi can fly, either as a mist (AT-1, DB=50) or in typical form; in neither case do they require wings."

        "description":"Demons of the Void are evil creatures who reside in the Nothingness outside Creation, apart from the Essence and beyond the known planes. They are of the realm at the very edge of Existence. Unlike Demons of the Pale, they are beings who were once of the \"high races\", but have long been changed. There are 3 kinds of these demons: 1). malformed spirits of fallen demigods; 2). Perverted elven spirits; and 3). Corrupt souls of immortal mannish spellcasters. All were cast into the Void as a result of heinous crimes or their own foul incantations. In any case, they were sundered from this world because of their own evil acts. Demons who dwell in the Void can only take form on known planes when under a summons or by entering a Gate to the Otherworlds. Since the Gates are guarded, their passage is often tied to a pardon, a rare event typically inspired by trickery. Like Demons of the Pale, these wicked spirits take distastful forms while in this world, thereby interacting with other beings. These forms serve as their conveyance, but are vulnerable and can be destroyed. Their \"real being\" or spirit, on the other hand, cannot be destroyed outside the Void.  Demons of the Void, like undead, are rated on a scale from I to VI, with Ordainers stretching off the bounds. An Ordainer may only be summoned by a spellcaster of at least 50th lvl utilizing a \"Summon Demons VI\" spell. They may never be controlled or mastered, although their presence outside the void usually requires the use of these spells.  The appropriate breakdown by numbers is: Type I, 5% (01-05); Type II, 8% (06-13); Type III, 20% (14-33); Type IV, 30% (34-63); Type V, 25% (64-88); Type VI, 10% (89-98); Ordainers, 2% (99-00).  While some are masterful enchanters, all these creatures can make use of spells from the Sorcerer base list \"Soul Destruction\" and the Evil Mentalist base list \"Mind Disease\".   The Daedhel, Culraug, Hodhedhel, Thauredhel, and the Celebdel arose out of the spirits of evil Evils. All possess the size (5.5-7 ft) and skills (e.g., infravision) they had in life, but have lost true form and have difficulty assuming fair guise. Like the skin of the Hodhedhel, so too is the skin of the Thauredhel, seemingly smooth and flawless. Outwardly indistinguishable from hodhedhel, these creatures wield considerably more power. No normal weapon can harm them. All Thauredhel possess at least 1 PP per lvl and know all the Evil Mentalist base lists (to their own lvl)."

Goblin hides dominate Troglodyte raiment, but the occasional Mannish or Elven skin stirs deep rage and horror in the one who recognizes a friend by its preserved details. Beneath this macabre clothing, Troglodytes possess muscled bodied with bluish-white skin (their own dead do not provide clothes). Sloping foreheads and massive jaws form the contours of their large heads and long, tangled, black hair grows from their scalps.

Some have jaws with detachable connections, enabling the snakes to free the upper and lower bones and swallow extremely large victims. Vipers ambush their prey, striking with their long poisonous fangs in frighteningly quicki attacks. Their muscle-poison immobilizes or kills their foes. Pit Vipers (e.g., rattlesnakes) are nocturnal varieties which use heat sensors to locate their quarry. Cobras use more powerful nerve-poisons which act faster and can kill very large prey, but cobra attacks are usually slower, and their venom is often delivered by a chewing rather than an injection method. Some cobras (10%), however, can spit their poison, blinding their adversary. Cobra-related Sea Snakes use the strongest venoms, but are entirely adapted to aquatic life and never venture on land (where their skeletons would collapse). Although air-breathers, they can stay under water for up to two hours. Of the non-poisonous varieties, constrictors (such as boas or pythons) are in many ways the most dangerous. Relatively large, they have strong teeth and use rapidly coiling movements to surround, entwine, strangle, and eventually swallow their prey."
